# Some key ideas about probability from last week

- _P(A|B)_ = _P(A,B)/P(B)_: A conditional probability can be thought of as the probability that both _A_ and _B_ occur, divided by the probability that _B_ occurs. Another way to think about this is as the fraction of _B_ events that also include _A_.
